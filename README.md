# Theo's Banana Solitaire

This is a word game inspired by Bananagrams, designed with a single player in mind. 

## Rules

To start, 21 tiles are drawn from a culmulative pool of 144 and placed in the player bar. You can DUMP a piece by dragging it over the dump area, where it will return to the pool and be replaced with three new letters, drawn at random. The RESET button will return all tiles placed on the board to the player bar. As of now, there is no specific end in mind -- just to consume as many letters from the pool as possible, arranging them into english words.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply clone the repository, create a python virtual environment with the `pygame` library installed, and run `main.py`.
